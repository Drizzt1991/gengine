Character movement in the world will be quite compact. As we operate in a 2d
world there will only be 2d vectors and we have no acceleration at client, so
we will have just 1 bit for movement velocity, however velocity can change 
based on player view direction.

Movement structure consists of next fields:
 - Character ID
 - Velocity 2d vector. Should be 1-length vector. TODO: Maybe sin+cos for less calculation.
 - View 2d vector. Should be 1-length vector.
 - Jump - 1bit. Will perform jump if not already in the air.
 - Rotation velocity - 2 bit. Possible values:
    1 - right rotation
    0 - no rotation
    -1 - left rotation

 * If character stands still send 0 velocity vector.
 * You can send 0 velocity vector with rotation velocity = 1. This will just rotate character.
 * If you pass velocity vector and rotation velocity, the velocity vector will be treated as 
   initial velocity and will slowly change according to rotation velocity.
