One of the main features of the World is ability to handle large amount if
characters on a single locations. The hardest part here is to manage 
character-to-character collisions in this croud. 

Rules:

  * If we have 2 players, that are running one at another, they should make a 
    little step each and run through if that is possible.
  * If we have a line of people standing tightly shoulder to shoulder, the
    other character running at it can not pass through.
  * If 2 ppl are standing in front of a character he can not run through unleass
    there is enough space behind them and the space between is at least X% (half?)
    of character capsule.


So basicly:
If the character can't pass through the other he will just stop, in other cases
he will try to dodge.

Dodging is performed by leaving the capsule for other to not capture the spot,
before we are sure the dodge is a success. If other players don't intercept the
dodge it is a success.

There exists a concept of pushing. If, and how effective it is will be 
determined by game stats (something like str comparison). Pushing effectiveness 
is also based on 'clustered' power of the pushing group and other factors, but
those do not move the pushing group, rather pushing just opens space in front
to where the group can step to.
