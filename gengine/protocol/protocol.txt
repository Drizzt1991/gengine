Protocol build on top of UDP to allow fast real-time updates on player 
positions and actions. Currently those conditions are required:
 * Connection must be reliable and no data can be sent before connection is
   established.
 * Updates on player states must contain a sequence number to determine last
   state.
 

Implementation:
 - Add ACK if Opcode requires it. On Client you can wait for ACK to be received
 - On CONNECT we will pass a session_id from client to server indicating, that
   this will be our connection. This ID will be used to trac player online 
   status by issuing a timeout after last operation on this ID.
